# Module-2-Challenge
Working with CSS

## User Story

Build a portfolio page, which you can add to as the course progresses.

## Aceptance Criteria

Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring managerâ€™s needs:

When the page is loaded the page presents your name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about you, your work, and how to contact you.
When one of the links in the navigation is clicked then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section.
When viewing the section about your work then the section contains titled images of your applications.
When presented with the your first application then that application's image should be larger in size than the others.
When images of the applications are clicked then the user is taken to that deployed application.
When the page is resized or viewed on various screens and devices then the layout is responsive and adapts to my viewport.
